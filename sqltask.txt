get all statuses, not repeating, alphabetically ordered
SELECT DISTINCT status FROM tasks ORDER BY status ASC;

get the count of all tasks in each project, order by tasks count
descending
SELECT projects.id, projects.name, COUNT(*) FROM projects JOIN tasks ON tasks.project_id = projects.id GROUP BY projects.id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

get the count of all tasks in each project, order by projects
names
SELECT projects.id, projects.name, COUNT(*) FROM projects JOIN tasks ON tasks.project_id = projects.id GROUP BY projects.id ORDER BY projects.name ASC;

get the tasks for all projects having the name beginning with
"N" letter
SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE name LIKE 'N%';

get the list of all projects containing the 'a' letter in the middle of
the name, and show the tasks count near each project. Mention
that there can exist projects without tasks and tasks with project_id = NULL
SELECT projects.name as name, COUNT(*) as count FROM projects RIGHT JOIN tasks ON tasks.project_id = projects.id GROUP BY name HAVING name LIKE '%a%' UNION SELECT projects.name as name, COUNT(*) as count FROM projects LEFT JOIN tasks ON tasks.project_id = projects.id GROUP BY name HAVING name LIKE '%a%';

get the list of tasks with duplicate names. Order alphabetically
SELECT name, COUNT(name) AS count FROM tasks GROUP BY name HAVING count > 1 ORDER BY name ASC;

get list of tasks having several exact matches of both name and
status, from the project 'Garage'. Order by matches count
SELECT * FROM tasks JOIN (SELECT id, name FROM projects WHERE name ="garage") as work ON tasks.project_id = work.id WHERE tasks.name IN (SELECT name FROM tasks GROUP BY name  HAVING COUNT(*) >1) AND tasks.status IN (SELECT status FROM tasks GROUP BY status HAVING COUNT(*) >1) ORDER BY tasks.name;

get the list of project names having more than 10 tasks in status
'completed'. Order by project_id
SELECT projects.name, COUNT(tasks.project_id) as count FROM projects JOIN tasks ON tasks.project_id = projects.id GROUP BY projects.id HAVING count > 10 ORDER BY tasks.project_id ASC;
